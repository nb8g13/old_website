I am a PhD student within the [Agent Interaction and Complexity group](https://www.aic.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/), supervised by [Long Tran-Thanh](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/long_tran-thanh/) and [Enrico Gerding](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/eg). Before starting my PhD, I received an MEng in computer science from the University of Southampton. My studies lie at the intersection between mechanism design and machine leanring. In short, my research goal is to develop machine learning algorithms for strategic settings, where individuals or organisations providing training data may have their own goals and incentives that may not completely align with those of the learner. This is my own personal website, which I will use to share my publications and make the occassional blog post (<i> no promises </i>). If you are interested in my work or in collaborating, feel free to get into contact via the email address linked in the sidebar!
